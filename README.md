# ðŸ§  js-oop-practice

A simple repository to practice and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript.  
This project covers key OOP fundamentals like:

- Factory Function  
- Constructor Function  
- Class Syntax  
- Class Inheritance using `extends` and `super`  

---

## What I learned

- The difference between factory functions, constructor functions, and classes  
- How `this` behaves differently with or without the `new` keyword  
- How to define methods using prototypes and inside classes  
- Creating a base class and extending it using `extends`  
- Using `super()` to call the constructor of the parent class  
- Organizing and structuring object-oriented code in a cleaner way using ES6 class syntax
